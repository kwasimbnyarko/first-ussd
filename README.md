# First USSD

This repo details my path on writing my first USSD Application

# HOW TO TEST

To test this spin up an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) server using port number 5111.
`$ ngrok http 5111`

(The port number can be changed in main.js when necessary)

run main.js
`$ node main.js`

Request a USSD extension from [Nalo Solutions Limited](https://app.nalosolutions.com/nalo/) using your ngrok url as the endpoint.
